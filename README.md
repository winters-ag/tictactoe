This Repo is for handling of the tic tac toe game board


## Roadmap for future
### Break out CSS into its own file
I would like to break out the css into its own file to clean up the code a bit. I think this is just best practice and will make things more readable.
### Disable button if it has been pushed
Like chess when you take your finger off the piece I believe once you have chosen a square you must keep that one. Given this I would like to implement that once a square has been selected, it will no long be able to be changed.
